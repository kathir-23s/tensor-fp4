Explored existing codebase (Dtype.h, Types.h, DtypeTraits.h)
Created implementation plan
Modified Dtype.h to add Float4_e2m1 and Float4_e2m1_2x enums
Modified Types.h to define float4_e2m1_t struct with conversion logic
Modified Types.h to define float4_e2m1_2x_t struct for packed storage
Modified DtypeTraits.h to register traits for new types
Modified DtypeTraits.h to add type promotion rules (promote to Float32)
Modified DtypeCastUtils.h to handle promotion logic
Created Tests/fp4_tests/test_fp4.cpp
Fixed compilation error in Types.h (missing closing brace)
Fixed duplicate case label in DtypeTraits.h
Fixed unpacking test failure by adding explicit casts in Types.h
Verified all tests passed
Refactored FP4 logic from Types.h to include/dtype/fp4.h
Fixed compilation errors during refactoring (namespace issues, stray braces)
Verified all tests passed after refactoring
Created Tests/fp4_tests/test_fp4_completeness.cpp to verify all 16 FP4 values
Verified all 16 values match IEEE 754 E2M1 standard
Created Tests/fp4_tests/test_fp4_to_fp32.cpp for exhaustive FP4->FP32 conversion testing
Created Tests/fp4_tests/test_fp32_to_fp4.cpp for FP32->FP4 conversion testing (exact, rounding, overflow)
Verified all conversion tests passed
Created 5 new test files for tensor operations (Basic Ops, Casting, Broadcasting, Mixed Precision, Comparisons) in Tests/fp4_tests/
